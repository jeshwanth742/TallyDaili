# TallyDaili 💸
### Tactical Daily Budgeting. 100% Private. Built with AI.

TallyDaili is a premium, minimalist budget tracker designed for **tactical daily liquidity**. Unlike traditional apps that focus on monthly categories, TallyDaili tells you exactly how much you can spend **today** while protecting your future bills.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Dynamic Daily Allowance**: Automatically calculates your "Safe to Spend" number for today, adjusting in real-time as you log expenses.
- **Planned Spending**: Reserve funds for future obligations (Rent, EMI, Bills). These reservations act as a "shield," hidden from your daily spending power.
- **Heat-map Calendar**: A high-fidelity visual history of your spending velocity.
- **Privacy First**: 100% local storage via Dexie.js. No cloud, no tracking, no account required.
- **PWA Ready**: Install it on your Android or iPhone directly from the browser for a native full-screen experience.

## 🤖 Built with AI: The Development Story

TallyDaili was created through a high-intensity collaborative process between the **User** and an **Advanced Agentic AI (Antigravity)**.

### How AI was used:
1.  **Iterative Architecture**: The AI didn't just write code; it architected the system using a formal `project_blueprint.md`, ensuring scalability and logic consistency before the first line was written.
2.  **Competitor Intelligence**: The AI performed a real-time `competitor_analysis.md` (vs. Monefy, Goodbudget, Buckwheat) to identify market gaps, leading to the creation of the unique **Planned Spending** shield logic.
3.  **Advanced Pair Programming**: The User provided tactical direction and UI preferences, while the AI managed state logic, persistence (IndexedDB), and high-performance React optimization.
4.  **Mobile-First Refinement**: The AI optimized all touch targets, spacing, and accessibility for a premium 100% Android-compliant feel.
5.  **Automated Verification**: Every feature was verified through AI-driven build checks and linting to ensure production-grade stability.
